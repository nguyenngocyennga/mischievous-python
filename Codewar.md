### [Tic-Tac-Toe-like table Generator](https://www.codewars.com/kata/5b817c2a0ce070ace8002be0)
**Challenge:**
Assuming that you get all the data in one array, you put a space around each value, | as a columns separator and multiple - as rows separator, with something like ["O", "X", " ", " ", "X", " ", "X", "O", " "] you should be returning this structure (inclusive of new lines):

```
 O | X |   
-----------
   | X |   
-----------
 X | O |   
 ```
**My solution:**
```python
def display_board(board, width):
    str = [i.center(3) for i in board]
    lines = f"\n{'-'*(4*width-1)}\n"
    res = []
    for i in range(0, len(str), width):
        res.append("|".join(str[i:i+width]))
    return lines.join(res)

### [Loose Change](https://www.codewars.com/kata/5571f712ddf00b54420000ee)
**Description:**
Welcome young Jedi! In this Kata you must create a function that takes an amount of US currency in cents, and returns a dictionary/hash which shows the least amount of coins used to make up that amount. The only coin denominations considered in this exercise are: Pennies (1¢), Nickels (5¢), Dimes (10¢) and Quarters (25¢). Therefor the dictionary returned should contain exactly 4 key/value pairs.

**My solution:**
```python
import math

def loose_change(cents):
    cents = math.floor(cents)
    if cents < 0: 
        nickels, pennies, dimes, quarters = 0, 0, 0, 0
    else:
        quarters = cents // 25
        dimes = (cents - quarters*25) // 10
        nickels = (cents - quarters*25 - dimes*10) // 5
        pennies = cents - quarters*25 - dimes*10 - nickels*5
    return {'Nickels': nickels, 'Pennies': pennies, 'Dimes': dimes, 'Quarters': quarters}

### [Sum of Digits / Digital Root](https://www.codewars.com/kata/541c8630095125aba6000c00)
**Description:**
Digital root is the recursive sum of all the digits in a number.

Given n, take the sum of the digits of n. If that value has more than one digit, continue reducing in this way until a single-digit number is produced. The input will be a non-negative integer.

Examples
```
    16  -->  1 + 6 = 7
   942  -->  9 + 4 + 2 = 15  -->  1 + 5 = 6
132189  -->  1 + 3 + 2 + 1 + 8 + 9 = 24  -->  2 + 4 = 6
493193  -->  4 + 9 + 3 + 1 + 9 + 3 = 29  -->  2 + 9 = 11  -->  1 + 1 = 2
```
**My solution:**
```python
def digital_root(num):
    if len(str(num)) == 1: return num # If 1 digit, return the digit
    return digital_root(sum([int(n) for n in str(num)])) # Recursion in Python

### [Potion Class 101](https://www.codewars.com/kata/5981ff1daf72e8747d000091)
**Description:**
This is your first potion class in Hogwarts and professor gave you a homework to figure out what color potion will turn into if he'll mix it with some other potion. All potions have some color that written down as RGB color from [0, 0, 0] to [255, 255, 255]. To make task more complicated teacher will do few mixing and after will ask you for final color. Besides color you also need to figure out what volume will have potion after final mix.

Task
Based on your programming background you managed to figure that after mixing two potions colors will mix as if mix two RGB colors. For example, if you'll mix potion that have color [255, 255, 0] and volume 10 with one that have color [0, 254, 0] and volume 5, you'll get new potion with color [170, 255, 0] and volume 15. So you decided to create a class Potion that will have two properties: color (a list (a tuple in Python) with 3 integers) and volume (a number), and one method mix that will accept another Potion and return a mixed Potion.

Example
```
felix_felicis       =  Potion([255, 255, 255],  7)
shrinking_solution  =  Potion([ 51, 102,  51], 12)
new_potion          =  felix_felicis.mix(shrinking_solution)

new_potion.color   ==  [127, 159, 127]
new_potion.volume  ==  19
```
Note: Use ceiling when calculating the resulting potion's color.
**My solution:**
```python
import math

class Potion:
    def __init__(self, color, volume):
        self.color = color
        self.volume = volume
    
    def mix(self, other):
        new_volume = self.volume + other.volume
        new_color = [math.ceil((self.color[i]*self.volume + other.color[i]*other.volume) / new_volume) for i in range(3)]
        return Potion(tuple(new_color), new_volume)
```

### [Find the odd int]()
**Description:**
Given an array of integers, find the one that appears an odd number of times.

There will always be only one integer that appears an odd number of times.

Examples
```
[7] should return 7, because it occurs 1 time (which is odd).
[0] should return 0, because it occurs 1 time (which is odd).
[1,1,2] should return 2, because it occurs 1 time (which is odd).
[0,1,0,1,0] should return 0, because it occurs 3 times (which is odd).
[1,2,2,3,3,3,4,3,3,3,2,2,1] should return 4, because it appears 1 time (which is odd).
```
**My solution:**
```python
def find_it(seq):
    dict = {num: seq.count(num) for num in set(seq) if seq.count(num) % 2 == 1}
    return list(dict)[0]
```

```
"din"      =>  "((("
"recede"   =>  "()()()"
"Success"  =>  ")())())"
"(( @"     =>  "))((" 
```
**My solution:**
```python
def duplicate_encode(word):
    str = ""
    for c in word.lower():
        if word.lower().count(c) == 1:
            str += "("
        else:
            str += ")"

        return "invalid string"
```

___
### [Password maker](https://www.codewars.com/kata/5637b03c6be7e01d99000046)
**Description:**
One suggestion to build a satisfactory password is to start with a memorable phrase or sentence and make a password by extracting the first letter of each word.

Even better is to replace some of those letters with numbers (e.g., the letter O can be replaced with the number 0):
- instead of including i or I put the number 1 in the password;
- instead of including o or O put the number 0 in the password;
- instead of including s or S put the number 5 in the password.

**My solution:**
```python
def make_password(phrase):
    password = [word[0] for word in phrase.split(" ")]
    for i in range(len(password)):
        if password[i].lower() == "i":
            password[i] = "1"
        elif password[i].lower() == "o":
            password[i] = "0"
        elif password[i].lower() == "s":
            password[i] = "5"
    return "".join(password)
```

### [DNA to RNA Conversion]()
**Description:**
Deoxyribonucleic acid, DNA is the primary information storage molecule in biological systems. It is composed of four nucleic acid bases Guanine ('G'), Cytosine ('C'), Adenine ('A'), and Thymine ('T').

Ribonucleic acid, RNA, is the primary messenger molecule in cells. RNA differs slightly from DNA its chemical structure and contains no Thymine. In RNA Thymine is replaced by another nucleic acid Uracil ('U').

Create a function which translates a given DNA string into RNA.

For example:
```
"GCAT"  =>  "GCAU"
The input string can be of arbitrary length - in particular, it may be empty. All input is guaranteed to be valid, i.e. each input string will only ever consist of 'G', 'C', 'A' and/or 'T'.
```
**My solution:**
```python
def dna_to_rna(dna):
    rna = ""
    for i in range(len(dna)):
        if dna[i] == "T":
            rna += "U"
        else:
            rna += dna[i]
    return rna
```
